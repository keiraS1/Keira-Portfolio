# Keira-Portfolio

## Description

The Webpage represents my work, as well as my contact information, resume and a short description about myself. For employers this is to give you an idea of the skills and knowledge I have learned and will continue to learn as I progress through each and every new project. Included in this webpage are HTML and CSS files.
