# Keira-Portfolio

## Description

The Webpage represents my work, as well as my contact information, resume and a short description about myself. For employers this is to give you an idea of the skills and knowledge I have learned and will continue to learn as I progress through each and every new project. Included in this webpage are HTML and CSS files.

## Usage 

The purpose for this webpage is to show employers my work, new and improved. Here you can explore the different projects I have worked on, collaborated on and refactored. This is the beginning of my web development portfolio, therefore there will be more content updated periodically.
